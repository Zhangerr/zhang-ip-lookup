Chrome plugin that makes some subtle changes in WHMCS to make working at BuycPanel a little easier :)

Features
-----
-  Tired of aiming for those *tiny* checkboxes on tables? Me too! Now you just have to click the row and the checkbox will **automatically** be selected/deselected. Don't worry, clicking on links won't trigger it!
-  Tired of *painstakingly* highlighting IP addresses after selecting a client? So am I! Just click on the IP and it'll **automagically** be selected! Now all you have to do is copy it!
  - **PROTIPÂ©:** Press CTRL+C to make your life that much easier!
  - **But wait... there's more!:** Save your hand from *carpal tunnel*: not only will the IP be highlighted **automagically**, dear friend, it will also **paste itself** into the **intelligence search bar** and **search automatically**! That's **50%** less mouse movement!
-  Finally, who likes to scroll down pages with clients that have **198470312897** orders *just for* clicking "invoice" or "delete"? **I sure don't.** It's a well known fact: **2 is greater (better) than 1**. We know how much you cherish those buttons, so we **cloned** them. That's right. Now, at the top of every client's summary, a *copy* of the "invoice" and "delete" buttons now **appear**. Just select those orders you want to process and *away you go!* The functionality is as if you had scrolled **all the way down** and clicked.
  - Due to technical difficulties, the cloned "mass update" button doesn't work. It's a poser, a fake :(. We apologize for any inconvenience.
